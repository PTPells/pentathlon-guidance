# Behind-the-Scenes Theory

## Systemic 1% Edges

“I was blown away by the system — seeing it in action. It’s not the first time I read something about productivity and how to organize your day, self-help in the grand scheme of things, but seeing it put into action for the first time… it really opened my eyes and I realized how to do it in a very practical way, down to starting, stopping, setting up the time schedule, fixing the five or six important things in your day… that was actually very very worthwhile.”

— Dr. Thomas Goerblich, Veterinarian and Journalist, Pentathlon III attendee

The specific details of peak productivity aren’t hard to understand in theory — it’s putting them into practice that makes the difference. Most people know a variety of things that would help them do better \(for instance, waking earlier in the day and doing one’s most important work immediately\), but the difficulty is in actually establishing those routines. 

This leads us to some simple-but-powerful ideas — for instance, we’ve noted that setting a target “sleep time” is both more effective and more important for long-term sustained success than setting a target wake time. After all, there’s not much use in waking up at 4AM if you went to bed at 1AM — you’re going to be exhausted and not get much done.

That sounds simple, but a variety of simple building blocks like that — we call them “1% edges” — can come together to make you 10%, 20%, 30% more effective.

Strangely, being 30% more effective on a given day can lead to being potentially double or triple as effective over a month — for instance, completing some work far in advance of a deadline means extra time to either improve and polish it further, or to take extra leisure to recharge fully, or to engage in some other not-urgent-but-important project that you otherwise might not make the time for.

The challenge, again, is identifying these 1% edges and putting them into practice and having them “stick” for you — we firmly believe that running at sustainable peak productivity for even a week or two can show you what’s possible, and that foundation can be built upon.

That’s the core of the Pentathlon — stacking up a large number of 1% edges and best practices, you committing to them, and then us supporting you with as many other elements that we know help someone stay motivated, inspired, consistent, and effective.

## Conative Knowledge

You probably know the word “cognitive” — which relates to thinking — but do you know the word “conative”?

Most people do not.

Conative knowledge is knowledge that relates directly to experience. 

The next two paragraphs from Stanley Rosenthal’s “The Tao Te Ching: An Introduction” might seem a little technical, but will be useful in helping you understand what we’re doing on the Pentathlon and help you encode the lessons you learn in a deep way, to be more effective forever.

Rosenthal —

“Consider a thing such as a strawberry. If we wish to find the word 'strawberry', we look in a dictionary; if we wish to find a description of a strawberry, we look in an encyclopedia. But if we are hungry, we do not go to the library, but to the field where fine strawberries may be found.

“\[…\] understanding stems from one of the two forms of knowledge. It stems from that which is called cognitive knowledge, the knowledge born of words and numbers, and other similar devices. The other form of knowledge, conative knowledge, needs no words or other such devices, for it is the form of knowledge born of direct personal experience. So it is that conative knowledge is also known as experiential knowledge. Cognitive and experiential knowledge both have their roots in reality, but reality is complex, and complexity is more of a barrier to cognitive knowledge than it is to experiential knowledge, for when we seek cognitive knowledge of a thing, that is, understanding of it, the knowledge we gain of that thing is understanding only of its manifestations, which is not knowledge of the thing itself."

Part of what we’re attempting to do at the Pentathlon — and it seems like we’ve been succeeding so far — is giving you both a conative understanding of what peak productivity feels like, so it’s fully experienced, as well as a supporting cognitive understanding so you that can identify what elements are helping you reach peak productivity, to build them into your life on a permanent basis.
