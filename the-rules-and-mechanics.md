# The Five Scored Categories of the Pentathlon

The Ultraworking Pentathlon will be scored on five points –

* Sleep/Wake Schedule
* Most Important Work \(scored for both Consistency and Depth\)
* Physical Fitness
* Nutrition
* Planning

Across all attendees, there are different mixes of experience and skill in these areas. Please remember that, while this is a competition, you’re competing more against yourself than other participants. 

The main point of the competition is to provide a backdrop that allows you to thrive as much as possible during the Pentathlon and to develop life-long skills.
