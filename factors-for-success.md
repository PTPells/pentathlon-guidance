## Core Pentathlon Things and Extra Things

We provide the resources, technology, and trainings for all the core elements of the Pentathlon — but we’ve noticed a few things that the most successful people do on the Pentathlon in addition to the core material.

We’re documenting them here so you can adopt those practices for yourself if you want — getting extra out of the Pentathlon in terms of higher performance immediately, and helping lock-in permanent gains for your life.

Five items we’ve found lead to a much greater experience on the Pentathlon and long-term gains —

1. Commit,
2. Counterplan
3. Journal and take notes,
4. Establish strong team dynamics.
5. Take a leadership role on your team.

## Mindset: Commitment

The largest thing you can do to help yourself succeed here is one that might sound boring, trite, and banal — you’ve no doubt heard it before — but genuinely committing to maximum excellence here is something we see the top performers often explicitly do.

“I made a decision I was going to win, that was the \#1 thing — I made a commitment. I was f’ing determined not to miss a single day — other people were clearly not missing their days. Most of this stuff is just showing up and doing it — so I did it.” — Michael Smith, perfect scoring on UWP3

Again, commitment can’t be overstated — Diarmuid Kidney runs a small tech agency in his civilian life, but is also a reserve NCO in the Irish Army. For half of Pentathlon 3, he was doing military training exercises. He explained,

“I knew what it would take to get it done. It was tough — really rough — since I was away for half the time doing full-time with the Army. I had to make a commitment to get up early, and do the most important work an hour before everyone would wake up, and get another hour done when we had a bit of downtime. It was tough, but I managed to do it.”

This theme recurs repeatedly among people who do excellent on the Pentathlon — they committed at the beginning to maxing out and doing excellent. It sounds simple, basic, maybe even trite — but it’s a consistent theme among the people who get the most out of the Pentathlon.

## Counterplanning For Success

There’s a somewhat silly and dangerous idea in the Western world right now that you should only think positive thoughts, and never think about anything that can go wrong.

Obviously, this is not how any successful organization runs — we have firefighting departments in every major city, engineers think constantly about safety conditions and possible points of failure, successful businesses are constantly assessing the changing risks to their business — but for some reason, there’s a silly idea being kicked around that you shouldn’t ever “think negatively.”

At Ultraworking, both our research and our experience shows that successful people think in advance about what can go wrong, and do “counterplanning” against that.

We have a number of prompts in our surveys and planning tech to help you counterplan, especially about fitness — things like thinking through, in advance, what to do if you’re very sore from your last workout the next time you go to the gym.

But successful people often go over and above that. For instance, if you have young children \(a number of competitors on the Pentathlon have young families\), what will you do the next day if one of your kids wakes you up in the middle of the night? Making a plan of what to do can be the difference between success and failure — in the parent’s case, perhaps something as simple as scheduling a nap if this happens, or having some simpler work related to your core most important work that can be done when you’re tired.

Everyone’s situation is different, but not totally unpredictable — think through, in advance, what could go wrong and what you will do if those things go wrong. Counterplanning means that unexpected disturbances are converted to something known and manageable, and it’s worth thinking through what could happen during the Pentathlon, as well as doing this periodically throughout everyday life.
