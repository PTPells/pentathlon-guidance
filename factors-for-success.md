## Core Pentathlon Things and Extra Things

We provide the resources, technology, and trainings for all the core elements of the Pentathlon — but we’ve noticed a few things that the most successful people do on the Pentathlon in addition to the core material.

We’re documenting them here so you can adopt those practices for yourself if you want — getting extra out of the Pentathlon in terms of higher performance immediately, and helping lock-in permanent gains for your life.

Five items we’ve found lead to a much greater experience on the Pentathlon and long-term gains —

1. Commit,
2. Counterplan
3. Journal and take notes,
4. Establish strong team dynamics.
5. Take a leadership role on your team.
