# So Why A Pentathlon?

For similar reasons that people go to a dojo to learn martial arts.

There’s a number of known best practices for learning and developing difficult skills — quick and personal feedback, consistency and routine, visible markers of progress, feedback loops, tradition and morale and momentum, interpersonal dynamics and having other motivated people around, instruction and training, and so on.

Notably, we structure the Pentathlon as a competition that has both individual and team aspects.

Studies have shown that athletes that train together, even in individual sports, have higher levels of endurance and power output, and report less fatigue after training with others in their sport than when training alone. That’s one reason why you see track teams and powerlifters often training together.

For whatever strange reason, people are far more willing to break commitments to themselves — whether related to doing one’s most important work, fitness, a good habit like planning each day, or whatever else — than they are to break commitments to a team and other people.

A number of past attendees have related how the team dynamics and momentum helped them not break their commitments and kept them aiming for perfect scores and hitting their targets — and again, once you see the gains and benefits from running at peak productivity for even a couple weeks, you’ve got the conative knowledge of it, and it becomes easier to establish those patterns going forwards in your own life.

“Only a few days into the Pentathlon, I thought I wanted to have some slack — but then I thought, I don’t want to let my teammates down. I need to get back to work and stay consistent in my habits. That helped me keep a perfect score.” — Mony Chhim

Tangible progress markers — daily and weekly scoring — additionally helps people mark and improve progress, as well as giving tangible feedback if things get off-track. It’s easy to have habits dissolve for unknown reasons if they’re not being tracked — but if they’re being tracked, measured, and scored daily, you get instant feedback if you miss your targets for a day, and can make immediate adjustments.
