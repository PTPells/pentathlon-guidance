## Journaling and Taking Notes

We’ve noticed that people who journal about their experience, and who take notes from the trainings, do better.

Maximilan Schoenberger took extensive notes on how to set up and run Work Cycles — his notes have been helpful both to himself in mastering personal productivity, and to everyone else who gets to read his notes.

Both Ultraworking founders, Sebastian Marshall and Kai Zau, keep daily journals.

This doesn’t need to be a big “production” — even a few sentences about how you’re feeling and reflecting on the upcoming important things of the day each morning, and perhaps a quick debrief in the evening, can go a long ways.

If you want a very simple journaling prompt, you could try what Marshall fills out at the end of every day —

What went right today?  What would I do differently?  What environmental factors affected me?   What am I currently improving?

The added benefit of keeping a journal is it lets you analyze what type of habits, moods, and work leads you to more success or less success over time — if you have a very successful week, for instance, you can re-read your journals and notes for lessons to implement permanently. It’s not essential, but it’s pretty well-proven to work and lead to learning a lot more about yourself — and thus to thrive more.

## Establish Strong Team Dynamics

A great team can go a long ways towards a great experience on the Pentathlon.

Unless a number of your real-world friends all joined the Pentathlon \(which is a good idea, and has worked for some people\), you don’t know all your teammates in advance.

The most successful teams establish a communication channel for themselves and use it.

Regarding strong team dynamics, let’s first discuss what doesn’t matter — the type of IT you use for communication doesn’t matter. A Slack channel, a private Facebook group, a WhatsApp group… any of these can work. There’s tradeoffs in each of them.

What does matter — commitment and momentum. There will be time during the Pentathlon onboarding session on the first Saturday to communicate with your team and choose a channel together. Once that’s chosen, gains come from committing to use it, and building momentum by using it the first few days especially.

Everyone on the Pentathlon has carved out two weeks for peak performance — these are like-minded people, and they can support you and you can support them — if you make the effort to do it.

“Once I started, I decided I wanted to put up perfect scores — and was happy to have another member of my team \(Kendra\) also put up perfect scores. For the team, I set up a simple Slack channel so we could communicate… just simple stuff, “Hey, hit my goals for the day” — or “I’m flying this weekend, any tips for keeping up targets I might miss?” It helped to analyze situations where we might miss, and I enjoyed getting to know people.” — Nick Winter, perfect-scoring and winning team during UWP2

## Take a Leadership Role on Your Team

Some people are more shy, and others are more outgoing — but we’ve noticed a definite pattern that teams where one or two members took a lead in sharing different types of information, asking questions, and encouraging teammates to join and use the channel helps a lot for success.

On Pentathlon 2, Barbara Garnier and Caroline Poser-Carrihlo messaged using the team channel, and also sent each other text messages to pick each other up and plan together. Barbara explained,

“The fact, being on a team with someone I know — Caroline who is amazingly good — of course there is an effect of pushing you forwards She pushed me forwards… even though I’m not competitive, the fact that she had such good scores, she’s so good, I’d like to have at least one day where I score the maximum points… so I’m competitive, but not that much pressure either… we communicated more on bad days, “don’t feel good”, “feel lazy”, “feel like I’m going to eat tons of sugar”, it was great safety net and motivation… like a friend basically. It puts a floor under your feet, there’s always just a few words to get some positive feedback.”

This type of communication is open to everyone — you merely need to take the initiative in sharing your experience, asking questions, encouraging your teammates, and looking for encouragement or strategizing together as needed.

People who take a leadership role in engaging their teammates, sharing their experience, and asking for feedback are \(unsurprisingly\) more effective and stick to their goals and targets at a much higher rate.

## Making Lessons and Gains Concrete and Permanent

Finally, we’ll again emphasize that we’d love for you to make more permanent gains as a result of participating in the Pentathlon.

To do that, it’s helpful to analyze what worked for you, and why, and to make those into some easy notes that you can refresh yourself on from time to time.

We look to prompt this with our surveys and questions we ask, but you can above and beyond it — marking down lessons learned, why particular techniques are effective, putting those into an easily reviewable format, and sharing those with others on your team, with us, and with real-life friends and colleagues can go a long way towards having better workflows, productivity, and thriving across your life.

We’re always very happy to review your notes and journals — if you came across anything interesting, definitely email us at sebastian@ultraworking.com and kai@ultraworking.com — we’re here to support you and love seeing you thrive.
