# Pentathlon {{book.pentathlonNumber}} Guidance: Overview

Top performers all around the world have joined the _Ultraworking Pentathlon_ to help reach peak performance during the Pentathlon, and to learn and cement lessons which lead to peak performance _forever_.

Since we started running the Pentathlon in mid-2016, we've had people join from dozens of countries in some of the most challenging professions in the world. We've had top attorneys, accountants, professionals, startup founders, managers, veterinarians, engineers, programmers, writers, translators, designers, marketers, and a whole host of other people join. We've had active duty soldiers and retired veterans, officers and NCOs, and we've received almost universal praise and acclaim for the effectiveness of the techniques.

We've also learned a lot since we started running the first Pentathlon, and we've decided to build out a knowledge base here on how to thrive on the Pentathlon. Some of the topics covered are absolutely essential, like guidelines on how to set targets smartly for fitness and recovery, choosing and focusing on one's Most Important Work, etc.

But we've also learned a lot of lessons about how great teams form, how to communicate to support a teammate and be supported in turn, and how that translates to higher levels of performance for everyone, as well as forming long-term friendships.

We're documenting some of these lessons here so that you can get the benefit of these lessons learned, and to thrive both now and in the future â€” thank you for reading, and we're thrilled to have you onboard.

Sebastian Marshall and Kai Zau
