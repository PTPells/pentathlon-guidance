## We’re Jazzed to Have You on the Pentathlon

Thanks again for joining — we’re looking forward to having some great sessions of peak productivity with you.

If you have any friends who’d be interested in joining the Pentathlon, it’s definitely a great way for friends to connect and support each other. Just point your friend to:

http://www.ultraworking.com/pentathlon/

There’ll be prompts after they join to request you as a teammate, and we’ll be happy to sort you onto the same team. \(We’ve even had husband-and-wife teams join together and have a great experience — which is awesome to see.\)

Beyond that, most of the guidelines in this document are optional — but we hope some of the theory and best practices here helps you get the most out of the Pentathlon, get your mindset right for it, build a strong team, and carry the lessons and gains forth for the rest of your life.

We’re excited and grateful to have you!

Yours, truly,

Sebastian Marshall and Kai Zau Ultraworking
