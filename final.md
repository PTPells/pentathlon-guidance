# Next Steps

The next step is to fill out the Competitor Public Targets form:

[https://goo.gl/forms/SMLkqGq65gxwSgO93](https://goo.gl/forms/SMLkqGq65gxwSgO93)

All of this information will be publicly shared with the other competitors exactly as you write it. If you have something that’s personal and you don’t want shared, but which is relevant, shoot us an email.

After we have this information, we’ll set up competitor profiles and send the variety of logins and technology guidance.

You excited? We’re excited. We're honored you're joining us, and here's to establishing new and greater baselines of performance alongside some great people.

Yours, truly,

Kai Zau and Sebastian Marshall

Thanks again for joining — we're looking forward to having some great sessions of peak productivity with you.



If you have any friends who'd be interested in joining the Pentathlon, it's definitely a great way for friends to connect and support each other. Just point your friend to:

There'll be prompts after they join to request you as a teammate, and we'll be happy to sort you onto the same team. \(We've even had husband-and-wife teams join together and have a great experience — which is awesome to see.\)



Beyond that, most of the guidelines in this document are optional — but we hope some of the theory and best practices here helps you get the most out of the Pentathlon, get your mindset right for it, build a strong team, and carry the lessons and gains forth for the rest of your life.

We're excited and grateful to have you!

Yours, truly,
